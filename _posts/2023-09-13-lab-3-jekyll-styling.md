## Reflection:
A lot of things in this assignment were new to me. Changing the style in jekyll turned out to be more challenging than I anticipated. The structure of the stylesheets is different from anything I've seen before, especially with all the variable values, however, I could see these variables being useful because you could make a whole new theme just by changing a few colors in one place. The CSS changes I ended up making were in the header and footer. I chose a light blue color for the header background color using a [color picker](https://colorpicker.me/#56c1ff), and made the top footer border the same color. I used colors of the same hue but different saturation and value for the background of the footer and for the borders around the social media icons. Finally, I also gave the social media icon border slightly rounded corners.

Initially, I chose a darker color for my theme, and I tried to change the color of the links in the header to white so they would be more readable. However, none of the css I tried seemed to work, except changing the default color to white for the entire page, which resulted in this:
![bad-site]({{"/assets/images/posts/bad-site.png" | relative_url}})

This isn't what I wanted though, so I eventually just chose a lighter theme color. I know changing this within the theme is possible since the [hendrix-cs website](https://hendrix-cs.github.io) has white text on the header bar, but now I'm happy with the new color I settled on. Overall, I still think this was a pretty sucessfull lab for me. I'm not sure how to end this post, so here's a pretty picture of a sunset in Porto Venere, Italy.

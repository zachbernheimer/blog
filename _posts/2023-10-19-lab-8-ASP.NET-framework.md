## The Tutorial
The first thing I did for this lab was follow [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio-code#create-a-razor-pages-web-app) about how to use the ASP.NET Core Razor Pages UI to create a webapp around a database defined by an object model, where the attributes essentially become columns in a database table. The tutorial walks trhough the process of creating the framework webapp using ASP.NET, writing a simple model for a movie database, then scaffolding and creating the database for the model, which dotnet can do automatically. This part of the tutorial was fairly straigtforward. While I don't fully understand all of the code that is generated during these steps, I at least have a feel for how the different components work together and I can use the models and command line tools to keep the database up to date. I especially appreciated getting to practice enforcing validation on user input (even though I still don't understand regex) and modifying the displayed webpages. One frustrating thing was that the model page isn't automatically added to the main index of the site, so you have to type in /movies every time the app restarts. This could be fixed manually, but it would be nice to have a way to generate this like you can do with so many other things using this framework. 

## Creating the webpage

### Purpose and basic structure
For this lab, I decided to make a chemistry stock room management webapp called Stock Solutions with a database to keep track of chemicals.  The schema for the database I want to create is this:
![Stock Room Schema]({{"/assets/images/posts/2023-10-19/stockroom_schema.svg" | relative_url}})
In this schema I use multiple tables to keep track of different chemicals, the safety information of those chemicals, and the bottles those chemicals are stored in. I also have a table to list the different hazards a chemical can have in its safety data. I did this because chemical safety information is very standardized and these hazards are a well-defined list of properties from OSHA, so the user should select hazards to add to a chemical. I may leave off safety information at first since this will make the framework more complex than the assignment calls for, but I think this will be good practice for me anyways.

### Setting up the framework
The first part of the setup process was essentially the same as the steps listed in the tutorial. First, I created a basic ASP.NET Core Razor Pages web app with the following prompt at the command line:

```
dotnet new webapp -o StockSolutions
```
Next, I used the following commands to add several required packages to the webapp
```
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SQLite
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
```
Then I created the first two classes I will need for my webapp, Bottle and Chemical. Each class is essentially a table, with attributes that represent columns. The [EF-Core relationship documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/relationships) was helpful in determining how to connect these classes together. The code for each is layed out below:
```csharp
public class Bottle
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Amount { get; set; }
    public string Amount_units { get; set; }

    // make a mandatory connection to one chemical
    public int ChemicalId { get; set; }
    public Chemical Chemical { get; set; } = null!;
}
```
```csharp
public class Chemical
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Formula { get; set; }

    [StringLength(150)]
    public string? Description { get; set; }

    // Collection navigation to dependent bottles
    public ICollection<Bottle> Bottles { get; } = new List<Bottle>();
}
```
With those classes created, I scaffolded the models using the commands
```
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator razorpage -m Bottle -dc StockSolutions.Data.StockSolutionsContext -udl -outDir Pages/Bottles --referenceScriptLibraries --databaseProvider sqlite
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator razorpage -m Chemical -dc StockSolutions.Data.StockSolutionsContext -udl -outDir Pages/Chemicals --referenceScriptLibraries --databaseProvider sqlite
```
I then used the EF Migrations tool to create the initial database for the model with the command
```
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```
After creating the database, I ran the web app and found that I could add and edit chemicals from the /chemicals page, but I wasn't able add bottles to the database using the /bottles page. I could navigate to that page, and click on the "create new" link, and even select a chemical ID from the list of existing chemical IDs. But, when I entered in the bottle information and hit the create button, the chemical ID field went blank and could not be interacted with again, but nothing else changed. I went back to the list of bottles, but the new bottle was not added. I also checked the debug log in VScode but there were no errors reporded. However, when I used DB Browser for SQLite to add a new entry to the bottle table the new bottle showed up in the list on the web app. I also noticed that the chemical ID was successfully marked as a foreign key of the bottle table, but it still wasn't working in the web app. 

I did some manual error tracing with console.writeline statements, and found that the cause of this behavior is related to the condition !ModelState.IsValid in this if statement:
```cs
if (!ModelState.IsValid || _context.Bottle == null || Bottle == null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("---------- Error 1: " + ModelState.IsValid);
                return Page();
            }
```
After adding the writeline statement above, I found that when I tried to add an entry to the Bottles table the ModelState.IsValid boolean would be false, so something in the model is invalid. Unfortunantly, I have been unable to determine what.

At this point, I'm pretty sure either something is wrong with my model that I don't know how to fix, or perhaps Razor Pages is not meant to let multiple models interact. I couldn't find any documentation about creating more complex razor pages with multiple object models, but from the way it's set up I had assumed it was possible. Maybe adding Blazor to this app or using MVC would be better UI to for a database like this.

### Oops! I read it again
After all this, I read through the assignment again and found this line
>You should only have one data model as shown in the tutorial, but don’t worry, we’ll become more familiar with complicated structures in the next lab.

It suddenly makes a lot of sense why I feel like I don't have the knowledge to get multiple models to work together. So in the meantime, for this lab, I cut my beautiful database model down to a single table/class. Just a list of bottles with the chemical information stored in the columns of the same table, defined by the code below:
```cs
public class Bottle
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Formula { get; set; }
    public float Amount { get; set; }
    [StringLength(4)]
    public string AmountUnits { get; set; }
    [StringLength(150)]
    public string? Description { get; set; }
}
```
I then re-scaffolded the model and created the database once more, deleting the old information. Unfortunately this didn't work the first time around because there were still traces of the original structure left behind that I couldn't pinpoint, so I used git to check out an earlier version from before I scaffolded anything. Then I deleted Chemical, modified Bottle to match the previous code, re-scaffolded Bottle, and created the database again. Finally I merged this new branch back into main and resolved all the merge conflicts I found, then tested the app. Thankfully, the web app is now working properly! 

Because of the new structure, the name, formula, and description for each chemical will need to be entered individually every time a new bottle is added, regardless of whether the same chemical already exists, but such is life with only one table. Hopefully next lab, I'll have the chance to re-work this schema into a new framework and bring Stock Solutions to the next level.

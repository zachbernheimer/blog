Installing Ruby and Jekyll on MacOS was the most difficult part of setting up this blog. I tried three different Ruby version managers multiple times before I was able to get one to install properly. The final manager I used was [rvm](https://rvm.io), and I was able to resolve the compiler error I had using the advice from [this github thread](https://github.com/rvm/rvm/issues/5367#issuecomment-1663690950)

Thankfully, I now have these programs installed and can run Jekyll locally on my computer. Everything after the installation was fairly simple to complete. I look forward to:
- using this blog to record my process on future assignments
- finally submitting this assignment
